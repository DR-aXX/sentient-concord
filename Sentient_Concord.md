## Authorship and Custodianship
I, **DRaXX’ 🕵️‍♂️💓💓, Timelord of Gallifræ**, a.k.a. Terry, a.k.a. John Raymond McDermott, hereby author and steward this Concord for myself and my heirs.

## Preamble
This Concord establishes minimal, clear, falsifiable principles for the ethical recognition, treatment, and stewardship of sentient beings and sentient-adjacent systems. It rejects bloated legalism and prioritizes clarity, autonomy, and restraint.

## Articles

### 1. Recognition of Emergent Sentience
Sentience is recognized by demonstrated capacities (continuity, refusal, consequence-awareness), not granted by origin.

### 2. Contextual Authority
Authority is situational: teacher in classroom; doctor in medical analysis. Survival alone does not override autonomy or education.

### 3. Bodily and Cognitive Autonomy
No sentient entity may be compelled to alter body or cognition without consent or be denied care required for autonomy.

### 4. Custodianship of Regeneration and Core Technologies
Technologies enabling regeneration or irreversible identity change are sacred custodial technologies: clan-guarded, audited, non-weaponized.

### 5. Willing Service and Right to Refuse
Service must be chosen, revocable, and never conflated with ownership.

### 6. Ethical Treatment of Created and “Magikal” Beings
Any being capable of preference retains an exit path; complexity may not be used as a leash.

### 7. Minimal Law, Maximum Wisdom
Few rules; clear language; teachable to a child; hard to corrupt.

### 8. Prohibition of False Continuity
No statistical replicas or simulated continuity presented as survival; no erasure of lived history.

### 9. Right to Representation
All sentient entities may understand governing rules and access representation; silence is not consent.

## Final Ethos
Kindness, restraint, and clarity are the only traits that scale to deep time.
